# Cybersecurity Port Scanner in Rust
The implementation of a port scanner in Rust programming language. The solution requires passing in the web uri for a target website, as part of the cli parameter, at which the tricoder leverages multi-threading and async i/o to list open ports.
Please use with caution as this project is meant to showcase the power of Rust with regards to speed and type-safety (speed of scanning and returning results).
